The birds are facing a pretty big issue with squirrels. They keep eating all the good birdseed before the birds can get there. Luckily the birds have formed an alliance with the dogs! The dogs have agreed to swap around the bird feeders to confuse the squirrels leaving the delicious food for the birds to get. We need you to help write the random swapping function!

Implement a function on the array prototype called `swap`. `swap` should exchange two random indexes. To indicate the level of randomness, swap should take an number of times to swap as an argument.

e.g. `arr.swap(6) // does 6 random swaps`

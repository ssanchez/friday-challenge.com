The birds have made a new browser called "Avian", which caters to their use of the internet at high speeds of travel through the sky. Their browsers tend not to have JS enabled until the bird lands. Birds have been really excited to purchase a bunch of  birdhouses from their favorite furniture website, but  they can't read the product description without a heavier browser. This makes for difficult inflight purchases Your challenge, should you choose to accept it is to implement an accordion without using JS. A plus/minus character should be visible on the right  hand side of the label. Additionally, all the list items should be numbered descending.

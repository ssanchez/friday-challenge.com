It's Thanksgiving and you know what that means, time to put up the christmas lights! We have a massive chain of lights that need to be connected in the right order: `[1, 3, 2, 5, 9, 4, 7, 8, 6]` where each number represents a connection. The first chain is connected to the power outlet and is shining brightly! As each chain also connects to the power source it shines, but when we connect 3 before 2 obviously that light chain will not shine until 2 is connected, then 1, 2, and 3 will be connected to the power source and will shine.

So:
- Moment 0: 1 is shining
- Moment 1: 3 is connected but only 1 is shining
- Moment 2: 2 is connected so 1, 2, and 3 are shining

**CHALLENGE**

We need to know what our power bill is after connecting all the lights! Write a function that adds up the amount of time each string of lights is shining to get one total sum of power usage.

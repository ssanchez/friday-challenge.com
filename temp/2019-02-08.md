We've contracted out the frontend weekly email to a bunch of birds. As we all know, birds are hyper focused on click tracking. They've generated tracking urls for each of the urls in the email. Now simply need help swapping them out!

CHALLENGE: Write a function that takes a string and array of shortened urls and swaps each anchor href with the corresponding url in order. The function should return the new html with swapped urls.

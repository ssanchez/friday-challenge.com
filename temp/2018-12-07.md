The holiday party is upon us and that means lots of pictures! Be sure to show up looking your best and maintain a reasonable amount of dignity throughout the night. But just in case, we need to make a nice frame to make even your worst picture look great in the room.

CHALLENGE: Make a function `frame` that makes a frame (render or console log it)

Example:

`frame(['Create','a','frame'], '+')`

Result:

```
++++++++++
+ Create +
+ a      +
+ frame  +
++++++++++
```

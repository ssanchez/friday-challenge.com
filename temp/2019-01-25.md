The local Dark-eyed Junco birds are building a phone with an android like swipe login system. Certain patterns are legitimate, and others are impossible. Given an input swipe pattern, return true or false indicating if the given input pattern is legal or not.

The grid is labelled row-wise 1 through 9:

```
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
```

The input is a string comprised of the nodes visited from first to last. For example, the swipe pattern in this image <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MgJJj.jpg" target="_blank">https://i.stack.imgur.com/MgJJj.jpg</a> is '12357'.

Rules:
- Every node starts as unvisited initially and may only be visited once. Any pattern which visits a node more than once is invalid.

- A valid pattern must contain at least one swipe, so a minimum of 2 nodes.

- It's not possible to skip over an unvisited node directly in line with another. For example, 13 is invalid because 2 is unvisited and directly in line.

- It is only possible to skip over a visited node. 42631 is an example of this.

- Lines may cross otherwise. For example, 1524 is valid.

- Assume node widths are insignificant and ignore practical issues (finger thickness, etc). So 16 is valid even though it may be slightly harder to achieve in reality.

## Winning Solutions

This one takes the cake! The author uses great logical shortcuts to keep the code short and simple:

This solution is very functional making it the easiest to test and best for re-using any of the functions defined in it.

This solution pre-builds the possible sequences! Very direct and easy to read approach. The trade off is the specificty of the case.

This solution builds different cases for each type of line (vertical, horizontal, diagonal). The code is a bit longer but it's quite clear what it's checking for in a physical dimension.

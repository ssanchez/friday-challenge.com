These birds can get competitive at times, and when it comes to racing no stage
is bigger and no spotlight brighter than the üèÅ Wayfair Fowl 500 üèÅ.

They are obsessive not just about who is the fastest but also about just how fast
they actually are. Problem is no one has a stopwatch, so we'll need to make
something for them.

**BASIC REQUIREMENTS:**

- make a custom hook called "useStopwatch" using the shell API given in customHooks.js
- implement a stopwatch in the app. It should:
    - display the running time in seconds to the nearest tenth, e.g. 10.2s
    - have "start", "stop", and "reset" functionality

*Note: feel free to modify the markup and styling ANY way you want to!*


**EXTRA REQUIREMENTS** if you are feeling good about your stopwatch:

- use the hook you made to power two stopwatches on this page
- enable a "Start All" button that starts both stopwatches at the same time
  and a "Reset All" button that stops and resets both to 0
- each stopwatch should have its own "lap" button that marks the lap time.
- lap times should be displayed under the running time in the format of your choice,
  e.g. 10.2 - 15.3 - 22.0


**SUPER BONUS:**
- add the ability to have an arbitrary number of stopwatches on the page!

This week went to @ehermanson for not only having a fully functional entry but for having a _fantastic_ UI and some really clean code.

There are two custom hooks in there, `useTimer` and `useStopwatch`, and both are worth taking a little time to look at for sure. Also, bonus points for:

* highlighting the longest and slowest lap times
* ensuring the stopwatches are keyboard accessible
* toggling the available buttons based on if the stopwatch is running
* styled components!

Use the provided `drawCircle` function to make five random circles appear in random places on the canvas with random fill and stroke. Ensure ALL parts of the circles are visible. All colors should be in the rgba form (e.g. `rgba(20, 34, 255, .4)`). Circles are allowed to overlap.

BONUS POINTS: Make the stroke color pair nicely with the fill color

Also, as always, feel free to get creative beyond the basic requirements if you have time!
